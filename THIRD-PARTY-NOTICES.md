GPL-3.0-compatible licenses (MIT, ISC, BSD, Apache-2.0, OFL-1.1 for fonts). External engines run as
separate programs, and each keeps its own license.

Blazma Cyber uses the following third-party components. Each was reviewed for license
compatibility, maintenance status, platform support and security implications before adoption.

## External engines (user-installed, never bundled) and evaluated options

| Engine | License | Planned integration | Assessment |
|---|---|---|---|
| YARA-X (VirusTotal) | BSD-3-Clause | **Integrated**: adapter to the user-installed `yr` CLI (tested with 1.20.0). Not bundled. | Actively maintained successor of YARA, memory-safe (Rust). |
| YARA (libyara) | BSD-3-Clause | Fallback only | Mature, in maintenance mode; YARA-X recommended by its authors. |
| hashcat | MIT | **Integrated**: user-installed executable, invoked by verified path with argument arrays | Compatible license; GPU acceleration; JSON status output. |
| John the Ripper (jumbo) | GPL-2.0 core, mixed for contributions | **Integrated**: user-installed executable only (never linked or bundled) | Best format coverage via `*2john` extractors; separate-process use avoids license coupling. |
| 7-Zip | LGPL-2.1 (+ unRAR restriction, BSD parts) | User-installed `7z.exe` | Safe archive listing for analysis/quarantine. |
| Microsoft Defender (`MpCmdRun.exe`) | OS component | **Integrated**: execFile with argument arrays | Detect availability; report-only file/folder scans. |
| Nmap | Nmap Public Source License (NPSL) | **Integrated**: user-installed `nmap.exe`, fixed profiles, argument arrays, XML output parsed | Not bundled (separate program the user installs from nmap.org); used only against the user's own networks. |
| Wireshark `dumpcap` + Npcap | GPL-2.0 / Npcap license | **Integrated**: user-installed `dumpcap.exe` for unelevated captures; "Open in Wireshark" for kept captures | Not bundled; pktmon (built into Windows) is used when absent. |

Adapted with permission of the same author: packet/protocol parsing ideas and code from
**blazma.nt** (MIT, © mr-kateba) in `src/core/traffic/`.

Rejected: unmaintained npm "hash identifier" and "PE parser" packages (small, easily implemented
and fully tested in-house: `src/core/hash-id.ts`, `src/core/pe.ts`); i18next (unnecessary for
this project's needs; replaced by `src/core/i18n.ts`).
